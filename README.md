# Dash

Dash is a crowd-sourced task delivery system, where users can post requests for tasks they would like to have done in a certain amount of time, as well as the price they are willing to pay, and other users can choose to fulfill said task in return for the payment. So far, the appâ€™s basic functionality (login/register, posting requests, accepting requests, timers, ratings, Google maps integration, push notifications, etc.) is complete, and the focus is on polishing the app and adding smaller features before it is ready to be released. The application is being developed on both Android and iOS, and will be released on both platforms. 

Dash was started by Leo Hentschker and I as our CS50 final project, and we both continued working on it for some time afterward. However, it is currently not in active development.
